            <p>
                Visual hierarchy is the method of arranging graphic elements by order of importance. 
                By relying on principles relating to size, color, contrast, white and more, 
                you can influence how users interact with your designs, from images to websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visual hierarchy affects what you look at and focus on in a design, 
                whether it's an image, graphic design, or web design. It's a key player 
                in ct (i.e., how information is organized and displayed for easy understanding and navigation) 
                and can greatly impact the user experience (UX).

            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>

            </p>
            While the rule of thirds can be a very useful tool, it is not necessary to plan your website design around it. 
            Use the philosophy as a guideline or a tool to tweak your design during the finalizing process. Toss an imaginary 
            grid on a new site design and consider making placement changes to items that are close to key spaces on the rule of thirds grid.
                <br><br>
                More importantly, the rule of thirds can be applied to working with images on your site. Use it to help you better crop and 
                scale images. Remember to keep in mind where the object of each photo falls and what kind of movement or feel it creates.

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <div>
            <p><span>Under Armour</span></p>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.underarmour.com/">underarmour.com</a></p>
            <p><img src="images/underarmour.jpg"
            alt="Screenshot of the Under Armour Website on cell phone view. Home page shows an woman doing set ups.">
            </p>
            <p>
            Contrast is when two or more very different (opposite) elements are placed together
            on the page. It can aid to legibly improve, visual interest, organization and hierarchy, 
            and in highlighting main messages. Contrast is achieved using colors, sizes, shapes, textures, 
            saturation, and position or alignment.
            </p>
            <p>
            This Underarmour Sports Wear advertisement is a good example of contrast with the use
            of opposite colors and textures. The home page features red, black and white colors on the image and
            fonts that contrast each other making them "pop" on the page attracting the viewer's attention.
