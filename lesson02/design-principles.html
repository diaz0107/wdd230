                <p>
                    Netflix uses a great method of arranging graphic elements by order of importance.
                    By relying on principles relating to size, color, contrast, white and more,
                    you can influence how users interact and they can purchase their services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Visual hierarchy affects what you look at and focus on in a design, whether 
                    it's an image, graphic design, or web design. Arranges graphic elements 
                    by order of importance. By relying on principles relating to size, color, 
                    contrast, white and more, you can influence how users interact with your designs, 
                    from images to websites.

            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <div>
                <p><span>Longway</span></p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.longwaycalifornia.com/">Longway California</a></p>

                </p>
                While the rule of thirds can be a very useful tool, it is not necessary 
                to plan your website design around it. Use the philosophy as a guideline 
                or a tool to tweak your design during the finalizing process. 
                <p>
                Toss an imaginary grid on a new site design and consider making placement 
                changes to items that are close to key spaces on the rule of thirds grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                More importantly, Longway uses the rule of thirds to working with images 
                on their site. They use it to scale their images. This way, they can keep 
                in mind where the object of each photo falls and what kind of movement or 
                feel it creates.

            <h3>Clean Design</h3>
            <div>
                <p><span>Google Fonts</span></p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a></p>
                <p><img src="images/google-fonts.jpg"
                        alt="Google fonts api page for an example of white space and a clean design">
                </p>
                <p>
                    White space, also known as “negative space,” is empty space around 
                    the content and functional elements of a page. The basic role of 
                    white space is to let your design breathe by reducing the 
                    amount of text and functional elements that users see at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google Fonts API has a good use of white-space making it have
                    a clean design. The spacing around all the objects allows
                    people who are viewing the page to stay calm when looking for
                    a font.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Google Fonts API, there is a clear Clean Design, all 
                    the fonts are separated into boxes and have spacing between them it
                    just makes it more simple.
