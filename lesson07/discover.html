				<b>Ottawa Demographics</b><br>
                Among the six largest cities in Canada, Ottawa had the third highest proportion of households with an after-tax income
				over $100,000 in 2016. Compared to 32% in Ottawa, Calgary had 39%, Edmonton 33%, Toronto 24%, Vancouver 24% and Montr√©al
				12%. Moreover, compared to those same cities, at 9%, Ottawa has one of the smaller proportions of households earning less
				than $20,000.<br><br>
                <b>Ottawa History</b><br>
                The first settlement was created in 1800 across from Ottawa in Hull by a New Englander named 'Philemon Wright'. The community, 
                called Wrightsville, became a pioneer in the Ottawa Valley timber trade. Bytown (later Ottawa) was founded in 1826 due to work 
                being done on the Rideau Canal. Barracks and a town were set up, and the population reached 1,000 as the Canal was being finished
                 in 1832. It was renamed Ottawa in 1855 and incorporated as a city.

In 1857, Queen Victoria chose Ottawa as the common capital for the Province of Canada. Through the 1850s, large sawmills were constructed, followed by rail lines. Public transportation grew quickly. In the 1990s, Ottawa had substantial growth in the high-tech industry, fueling further growth in the city's economy and population.

				<b>Population distribution by age</b><br>
                Ottawa population in 2022 is estimated to be 1.18 million, covers city area of 2,790.30 sq km (1,077.34 sq mi), fourth largest city in Canada. According
			    to statcan data Ottawa population in 2020 estimates are 1,111,773 people. Ottawa refers from Ottawa River, from the Algonquin
			    language Odawa, means trade.</p>
                <b>Ottawa City Size and Population Density</b><br>
                The city proper has a population density of 317 people per square kilometer (820/sq mi). The city covers a total surface area of 2,778.13 kilometers squared
                 (1,072.9 square miles).<br><br>
                 <b>Population distribution by age</b><br>
                 Since the 1980s, about three-quarters of the city's growth has been attributed to relocation from other cities, as well as foreign immigration. The Ottawa 
                 metropolitan area has now outpaced the national average growth rate for more than 7 years.
