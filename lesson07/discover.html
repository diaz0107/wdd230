				<b>Ottawa History and Demographics</b><br>
                <br>Ottawa, city, capital of Canada, located in southeastern Ontario. In the eastern extreme of the province, Ottawa is situated on
                 the south bank of the Ottawa River across from Gatineau, Quebec, at the confluence of the Ottawa (Outaouais), Gatineau, and Rideau rivers. 
                 <br><br>The Ottawa River (some 790 miles [1,270 km] long), the principal tributary of the St. Lawrence River, was a key factor in the city‚Äôs 
                 settlement and development; its watershed, covering more than 57,000 square miles (148,000 square km), facilitated the transport of 
                 resources such as furs, timber, and minerals from the region. <br><br>The river‚Äôs Chaudi√®re Falls, just west of the Rideau Canal, while initially 
                 a navigational hazard for the fur trade and later for the transport of logging rafts, ultimately proved to be an asset in the production
                 of hydroelectric power for the city and a boon to the growth of industry.<br>
                The first settlement was created in 1800 across from Ottawa in Hull by a New Englander named 'Philemon Wright'. The community, 
                called Wrightsville, became a pioneer in the Ottawa Valley timber trade.<br> 
                <br>Bytown (later Ottawa) was founded in 1826 due to work being done on the Rideau Canal. Barracks and a town were set up, and 
                the population reached 1,000 as the Canal was being finished in 1832. It was renamed Ottawa in 1855 and incorporated as a city.<br><br>
                <hr><br><b>British Monarchy</b><br>
                In 1857, Queen Victoria chose Ottawa as the common capital for the Province of Canada. Through the 1850s, large sawmills were constructed, 
                followed by rail lines. Public transportation grew quickly. In the 1990s, Ottawa had substantial growth in the high-tech industry, fueling 
                further growth in the city's economy and population.<br><br>

                Originally a trading and lumbering community that grew into a town of regional significance, Ottawa was named the capital of the Province 
                of Canada in 1857 and retained that status when Canada became a dominion within the British Commonwealth in 1867. 
                <br><br>Since the 1980s, about three-quarters of the city's growth has been attributed to relocation from other cities, as well as foreign immigration. 
                The Ottawa metropolitan area has now outpaced the national average growth rate for more than 7 years.<br>
                <br><hr>
                <br><b>Population distribution by age</b><br>
                Ottawa population in 2022 is estimated to be 1.18 million, covers city area of 2,790.30 sq km (1,077.34 sq mi), fourth largest city in Canada. According
			    to statcan data Ottawa population in 2020 estimates are 1,111,773 people. Ottawa refers from Ottawa River, from the Algonquin
			    language Odawa, means trade.</p>
                <hr>
                <br><b>Ottawa City Size and Density</b><br>
                The city proper has a population density of 317 people per square kilometer (820/sq mi). The city covers a total surface area of 2,778.13 kilometers squared
                 (1,072.9 square miles).<br>
