    <p>Hi Class. Let me introduce my self. I am married to my eternal Companion, Maria. We are a bonded family, I have two boys, and Maria has one boy and two wonderful girls.</p>
    <p>I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. I came to Ottawa, Canada, in 1976, where I have been here since. 
        I studied Digital Electronics in 1984. I have been working in the Government of Canada for 31 years.
        <p> I work as a Senior Technical Support Specialist in the Windows Team with experience supporting Windows servers 2008R2, 2012R2, 2016, and now Windows server 2019. I am a GrandFather of 5 extraordinary Grandchildren. </p>
        I also enjoy cooking for my Eternal companion, and the missionaries. I enjoy eating Pabellón. Venezuela is well-known for its rich culture and diversified population. And lucky for us, <p>various ethnic backgrounds translate into an outstanding cuisine. There’s no better way to relish that cuisine than savoring their national dish: Pabellón Criollo.</p>
        <img alt="Image of me?" src="images/Pabellon.jpg"  />
        <p><I love school, especially BYU- Idaho, and this has been the most fantastic experience to study with you.</p>
        <p>I am working towards a Bachelor in Applied technology and this is my first time taking Web Development. I am looking forward to helping non-profit organizations
        build web pages. <p>I am looking forward to getting to know you and learning from one another.</p>
        <p> I have been a member of the church since 2013. I have three years left to retire from 35 years of service in the Government of Canada. How would this course help me? <p>I think it would help me with the knowledge of Web Development 
        so I can help non-profit organizations.
        <p>Thank you.</p>
        <p><Regards,</>
        Ben
